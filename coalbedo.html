    <h1>Azimuth simple climate model examples</h1>
    
    <p>
        These charts were produced for John Baez's <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">Azimuth Project</a> to illustrate some simple models of
        climate from the (as yet unpublished book):
        <ul><li> Gerald R. North, <i>Simple Models of Global Climate</i>.</li></ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They were included in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week319.html">Week 319 of This Weeks Finds</a>, so
        please look there for a nice explanation of the model (in a much broader context of predicting Ice age cycles!).
        The purpose of this page is just to update the usage of the 
        <a href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/">JSXGraph</a> software to be a bit easier
        to follow (should anyone be interested in building further upon the examples).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This indeed the hope over at the <a href="">Azimuth Forum</a>, so if you would like to help out please
        introduce yourself and find out more about the project, which is staring down the barrel of producing
        interactive examples the rest of the book!

    <h2>Insolation against temperature</h2>
    
    <p>
        The main graph below plots the equilibrium insolation \(Q_\textrm{eq}\) against temperature \(T\) for the
        given value of \(\gamma\) controlled by the slider to the right.  Below that, the inset graph to the right
        is of the coalbedo funtion \(a_p\) for the given \(\gamma\).
